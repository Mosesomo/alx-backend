Caching:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Caching in backend development refers to the process of storing frequently accessed data or computed results in temporary memory for faster retrieval. This data can include anything from database query results, API responses, rendered HTML pages, or even entire objects or components.

The primary purpose of caching is to improve the performance and responsiveness of an application by reducing the need to repeatedly fetch or compute the same data. Instead of going through time-consuming processes such as querying a database or making expensive API calls every time a request is received, the application can retrieve the data from the cache, which typically offers much faster access times.
